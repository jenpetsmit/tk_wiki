# Collecting Your Cloud Access Credentials
To access SRA cloud-data, you need to provide your AWS (Amazon Web Services) access key or GCP (Google Cloud Platform) service account to vdb-config. You need appropriate permissions to follow the steps below. See links to Cloud documentation for more information.

**Cloud credentials are like passwords, be careful with how they're handled!**

Note: Some organizations manage cloud credentials differently. Check with your system administrators If the steps do not work, check with your system administrator or review [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html).

## Amazon
