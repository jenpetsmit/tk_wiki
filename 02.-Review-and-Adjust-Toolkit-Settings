# Review and Adjust Toolkit Settings  

If you have downloaded an older version of Toolkit, [check here](/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit.html) to see if there is a newer version. Before installing a newer version, delete or remove the outdated version. [Update your PATH variable](/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit.html#_Set_the_PATH) to the new version. 

Toolkit installs with default settings. Review and adjust these settings using the _vdb-config_ tool.
