# Review and Adjust Toolkit Settings  

If you have downloaded an older version of Toolkit, [check here](/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit.html) to see if there is a newer version. Before installing a newer version, delete or remove the outdated version. [Update your PATH variable](/01.-Downloading-SRA-Toolkit.html#_Set_the_PATH) to the new version. 

Toolkit installs with default settings. Review and adjust these settings using the _vdb-config_ tool. 

## Adjust Toolkit Settings Using the _vdb-config_ Tool 

**vdb-config Tool**

The _vdb-config_ tool is a user interface used for adjusting Toolkit settings. See Figure. Alternatively, you can use a terminal window and type [vdb-config- ADD LINK To APPENDIX WITH COMMANDS}(/vdb-config-commmands.html) commands to adjust settings.

1. From the command line, type the following command to open the vdb-config tool interface: 

`vdb-fig -i`

![vdb-config -i Command](images/02/vdb-config-i.png)

2. Press the **Enter** key and wait for interface to load. It may take a few moments to load. 

The blue _vdb-config_ interface displays. 

To move the cursor on the _vdb-config_ screen: 

* PC: Press the **Tab** key on a PC  

* Mac: Press **Option and Tab keys** at the same time to jump to the next option  

* Press the **letter key** that corresponds to the option with the red letter 

## Main Tab 

From the interactive vdb-config screen, the Main tab on the vdb-config page displays.

### Enable Remote Access Option

4. Press the **E key** until the **X** displays in the box to Enable Remote Access.

## Preferring SRA Lite files (simplified base quality scores) 

5. To download SRA Lite files with simplified base quality scores, press the **Q key** until an _X_ displays in the box next to _Prefer SRA Lite files with simplified base quality scores_.  

![vdb-config -i Command](images/02/vdb-config-main-qualityscores.png)

  i. To download SRA format with full per base quality scores (download is slower and uses more storage), leave the option not selected or press the **Q key** until the _X_ nolonger displays. 

For more information about SRA and SRA Lite formats, see [SRA Data Formats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-data-formats/). 

## Cache Tab

The **Cache** tab is where you indicate two locations for Toolkit work to occur: 

* Where to store downloaded files (_user-repository_)  

* Where to convert data from one format to another (_process-local_) 

If you need more information on selecting a location for user-repository or process-local, see [Things to Know](wiki.html#Things-to-know) for more information.  

### Enable _local file-caching_

This option is already enabled. It should _only_ be deselected in special cases (e.g., compute-clusters when a common location cannot be configured. 

### Location of user-repository  

8. Set the location of the _user-repository_. The folder must be empty to be added in the text field. 

If you do not enter a path for the _user-repository_ and run the _prefetch tool_, the files download to the current working directory. 

In Linux or Mac  

* For _user-repository_, select **/data/$USER** 

   - As _/home/$USER_ is limited to a quota of 16 GB 

### Location of process-local 

9. Set the location of _process-local_

If a location is not identified for process-local in Toolkit settings, Toolkit will likely download to current working directory.  The _fasterq-dump tool_ will warn you if it estimates there is not enough space. 

 

Press the C key to display the Cache tab. You may need to scroll to see the top menu.
