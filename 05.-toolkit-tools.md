# Toolkit Tools and How They Work Together

Toolkit comes with many tools which are commands you type in a command line terminal.
This section covers the most popular tools and how they work together:
•	Prefetch
•	fastq-dump
•	fasterq-dump
•	Sam-dump
•	cache-mgr

4.1	The Prefetch Tool
The prefetch tool’s primary job is to download data in the .sra or .sralite format along with supporting cache or reference files, if any. 
Prefetch data downloads to the user-repository cache if a location was selected in vdb-config interface. Otherwise, data downloads to the working directory. Data and reference files persist in the user-repository until you use the cache-mgr  tool to remove the data. 
Prefetch has a default maximum download setting of 20,971,520 KB, which helps prevent accidently overloading your storage capacity. You can change the maximum download setting.
Prefetch Benefits
Using prefetch to download sequence files is a best practice that has several benefits:
•	You can convert accessions from .sra or .sra lite format to your desired format locally
•	It is simpler and faster than manually downloading sequence files
•	Once files are downloaded, you no longer need access to the internet
•	If the download times out or is not able to complete, you can run prefetch again and it picks up where it left off.
•	Downloads include test files and needed references.

4.1.1	Downloading a Single Accession Using Prefetch
These instructions assume you have installed Toolkit and edited the settings in vdb-config including setting up a user-repository to hold prefetched data.
To download one accession’s sequence data, enter the following in the command line:
prefetch SRR###### 
Prefetch connects to the closest data source and downloads the information. It creates a folder in your user-repository called Accession as Directory. In the figure below it is named sra. Prefetched files download here. Do not rename this folder created by the prefetch command. Other Toolkit tools will look for this folder by its name.
